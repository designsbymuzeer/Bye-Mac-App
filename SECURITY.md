## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take security seriously. If you discover a vulnerability in this project:

**Please do not open a public issue.**

Instead, please use GitHub's **Private Vulnerability Reporting** feature:

1. Go to the **Security** tab of this repository.
2. Click on **"Report a vulnerability"**.
3. Fill out the details.

This will open a private discussion with me where we can fix the issue safely.
