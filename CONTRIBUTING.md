# Contributing to [Bye App]

Hi! Thanks for checking out [Bye App]. I am a designer who coded this project (using AI tools to bring my vision to life), and I would love your help to make it better.

## How can you help?
* **Found a bug?** Open an Issue and tell me how to recreate it.
* **Have an idea?** Open a Discussion or Issue first. Please don't write a lot of code before we agree it's a good fit!

## For Developers (The Vibe Code Warning)
Since this codebase was generated with AI assistance, some parts might look "unconventional" to a seasoned Swift developer.
* **Refactoring:** If you want to clean up the code, please explain *why* it helps (e.g., "This prevents a crash" vs "This looks prettier").
* **AI Code:** If you use AI to generate your PRs, please verify they actually build and run before submitting.

## Pull Request Process
1.  Fork the repo.
2.  Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`).
